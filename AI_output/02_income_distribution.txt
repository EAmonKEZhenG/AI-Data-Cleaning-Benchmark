I have uploaded CensusProfile2021...csv. Task: Act as a Data Scientist. I need you to visualize the Household Income Distribution for 2020 based on this data. Specific Requirements: Filter for the topic "Income of households in 2020". Identify the rows representing income brackets (e.g., "Under $5,000", "$5,000 to $9,999", etc.). Critical Step: Ensure the x-axis is sorted logically (by income amount), not alphabetically. Exclude summary statistics like "Median total income" or "Average total income". I only want the histogram bins. Output: A bar chart showing the distribution, and a calculation of the percentage of households earning over $100,000.
