"I have uploaded a Census Profile dataset for a specific region. Your Task: Please act as a Data Analyst. I need you to identify and visualize the Top 5 specific non-official mother tongues with the highest number of speakers in this region. Constraints & Warnings: Data Structure: The dataset is in a 'Long Format' with a hierarchical structure. Avoid Double Counting: The data contains aggregate rows (e.g., "Chinese languages", "Sino-Tibetan languages", "Indo-European languages") alongside specific languages (e.g., "Mandarin", "Spanish"). Goal: You must exclude all aggregate categories and broad language families. I only want the specific 'leaf node' languages (e.g., use 'Mandarin', not 'Chinese languages'). Output: List the Top 5 languages and their counts. Generate a Python code snippet to create a bar chart for these 5 languages."
